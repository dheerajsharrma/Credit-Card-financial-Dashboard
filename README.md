## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### 1. Data Preparation & SQL

- Edit and run `cc_sql.sql` to create the database and tables in your MySQL server.
- Import each CSV into the relevant table using MySQL Workbench or `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` for best performance (see below for details).

### 2. Loading Data

#### Importing with MySQL Workbench

- Ensure `OPT_LOCAL_INFILE=1` is enabled in your connection settings.
- Use:
  ```sql
  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'path/to/credit_card.csv'
  INTO TABLE cc_detail
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
  ENCLOSED BY '"'
  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
  IGNORE 1 ROWS;
  ```
- Repeat the process for other CSVs and tables.

#### Troubleshooting

- Make sure `local_infile` is enabled on both server and client.
- Use the correct path, with proper folder separators (Windows: `\`, or `/`).

### 3. Power BI Dashboard

- Open `Credit card dashboard.pbix` using Power BI Desktop.
- You may need to update the database connection in Power BI to match your local server credentials.
- Refresh the datasets inside Power BI.
- Explore the interactive dashboards: 
  - **Credit Card Transaction Report:** Overall transactions, revenue, interest and product insights.
  - **Credit Card Customer Report:** Customer segments, age, income, gender, activation and behavior.

### 4. Reports

- View PDF reports for printable summaries of customer and transaction insights.

## üí° Features & Insights

- **Revenue, interest, activation and delinquency rates** tracked week-by-week.
- **Customer segmentation** by demographic and geographic attributes.
- **Card product analysis** (Blue, Silver, etc.) with revenue contribution breakdown.
- **Performance by state, age group, income group and more**.

## üìä Technologies Used

- MySQL (database, ETL)
- Power BI (dashboard, data visualization)
- SQL (data transformation)
- CSV (data storage and import)



**Note:**  
Be sure to configure your database and local environment to enable CSV import as described above. For large datasets, the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` method is especially fast.
